# SLRC-19 Robot

This repository contains my first robotics project where I competed at the Sri Lankan Robotics Challenge - 2019. Our team obtained 8th place in the competition, which is a considerable achievement considering the time period we had to build from the ground.

The video of our run in the competition is attached below.
